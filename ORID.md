O:
Today, I learned and came into contact with the three-layer architecture of Spring Boot, including the design ideas of Controller, Service, and Repository, while practicing interface development based on RESTful API. I have attempted the linkage operation between the database and IDEA in practice.
R:
During the learning process, I found that the three-layer architecture of Spring Boot has clear thinking and logical layering, which brings great convenience to practical development. The design of RESTful API makes interface calls more intuitive, but unfortunately the connection to the database is not smooth.
I:
Through today's learning, I have deeply felt the advantages of layered architecture, which not only improves the maintainability of the code, but also strengthens my understanding of the backend development process. At the same time, the combination of databases and tools has further improved development efficiency and accumulated practical experience for future project development.
D:
The next plan is to consolidate the application of the three-tier architecture, attempt to design more complex RESTful APIs, and strengthen research on database optimization, familiarize oneself with more efficient development tools and plugins, in order to enhance comprehensive development capabilities.
